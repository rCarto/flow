Description: The analysis and representation of flows often presuppose a selection
    to facilitate interpretation. Various methods have been proposed for selecting
    flows, one of the most widely used being based on major flows: it selects only
    the most important flows, absolute or relative, on a local or global scale.
    These methods often highlight hierarchies between locations, but the loss of
    information caused by selection is rarely taken into account. It therefore
    seems useful to propose statistical indicators to assess the loss of information
    and the characteristics of selected flows. We provide functions that select
    flows (main, dominant or major flows), provide statistics on selections and
    offer visualizations in the form of maps and graphs.

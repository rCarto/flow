#' @title Flow selection
#' @name select_flows
#' @description Flow selection from origins.
#' @param mat A square matrix of flows.
#' @param method A method of flow selection, one of "dominant", "nfirst",
#' "xfirst" or "xsumfirst":
#' \itemize{
#' \item{dominant selects the dominant flows (see Details)}
#' \item{nfirst selects the k first flows from origins,}
#' \item{xfirst selects flows greater than k,}
#' \item{xsumfirst selects as many flows as necessary for each origin so that their sum is at least equal to k.
#' If k is not reached for one origin, all its flows are selected.}
#' }
#' @param ties In case of equality with "nfirst" method, use "random" or "first" (see \link{rank}).
#' @param global If TRUE flows selections is done at the matrix scale.
#' @param k Selection threshold for nfirst, xfirst and xsumfirst methods,
#' ratio for dominant method.
#' @param w A vector of units weigths (sum of incoming flows, sum of outgoing flows...).
#' @export
#' @return
#' A boolean matrix of selected flows.
#' Use element-wise multiplication to get flows intensity.
#' @details
#' If method = "dominant", select which flow (fij or fji) must be kept.
#' If the ratio weight of destination (wj) / weight of origin (wi) is greater
#' than k, then fij is selected and fji is not.
#' This function can perform the second criterion of the Nystuen &
#' Dacey's dominants flows analysis.
